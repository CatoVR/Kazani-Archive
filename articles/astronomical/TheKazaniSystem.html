        <h2 id="section1">1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Kazani System is the gravitationally bound system of the Star Kazani (CHG-24a) and the objects that orbit it. It was formed 5.2 billion relative years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, forming the Star and a protoplanetary disc. The Star is an ordinary main sequence star that maintains a balanced equilibrium by the fusion of hydrogen into helium at its core, releasing this energy from its outer photosphere.</p>
    <p>The largest objects that orbit the Sun are the ten planets. In order from the Star, they are three terrestrial planets (WX-1, WX-2, WX-3); an water planet in the habitable zone for water life (OZ-1); two more terrestrial planets within the habitable zone for ammonia life(WY-1, WY-2) three gas giants (TX-1, TX-2, TX-3). All terrestrial planets have solid surfaces. Inversely, all giant planets do not have a definite surface, as they are mainly composed of gases and liquids. Over 99.89% of the Solar System's mass is in the Star and nearly 95% of the remaining mass is spread over the gas giants.</p>
    <p>There are a vast number of small Solar System bodies, such as asteroids, comets, centaurs, meteoroids, and interplanetary dust clouds. Some of these bodies are in the small asteroid belt (between TX-1's and TX-2's orbit) and the big asteroid belt (just outside TX-2's). most bodies have orbiting natural satellites, which are commonly called 'moons'.</p>            
    <p>The Solar System is constantly flooded by the Sun's charged particles, the solar wind, forming the heliosphere. Around 75–90 astronomical units from the Sun, the solar wind is halted, resulting in the heliopause. This is the boundary of the Solar System to interstellar space. The outermost region of the Solar System is the theorized Oort cloud, the source for long-period comets, extending to a radius of 2,000–200,000 astronomical units (0.032–3.2 light-years).</p>
